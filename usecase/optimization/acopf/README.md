# Neural Network Verification of AC-OPF Proxies

**Minimizing worst-case violations of neural networks for AC Optimal Power Flow during training.**

For the first time, we verify all AC-OPF constraints of an AC-OPF proxy and minimize all worst-case violations during training. Read our paper now on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23196)!

## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains the code for the **AC Verification** project, which focuses on **minimizing worst-case violations of neural networks for AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) during training**.

The project includes two main components:

- **MinMax:** Core logic for training neural networks and minimizing worst-case violations during training.
- **Verification:** Core logic for neural network verification.

The emphasis is on **minimizing worst-case violations during training** to increase trustworthiness of AC-OPF proxies.
